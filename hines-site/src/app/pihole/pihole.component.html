      <p>
        To get started, install PiHole onto your raspberry pi by logging into it
        via ssh, using the username: 'pi', and the password 'raspberry'. Then
        download the PiHole installer by running this command:
      </p>
      <div>
        <code> curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash </code>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>
        Then, when the installer pops up, hit enter to continue. You will then
        have to choose an interface.
      </p>
      <li>Choose which interface to use</li>
      <p>eth0 for ethernet, and wlan for wifi</p>

        alt="PiHole interface"
      />
      <li>Choose a DNS provider</li>
      <p>
        I prefer to use the Google DNS, but choose whichever one you are most
        comfortable with.
      </p>
      <img
        class="pihole_image"
        src="../../assets/pihole/pihole_dns.webp"
        alt="PiHole dns"
      />
      <li>Choose third-party lists for ad blocking</li>
      <p>I would suggest to use the space bar to select them all</p>
      <img
        class="pihole_image"
        src="../../assets/pihole/pihole_lists.webp"
        alt="PiHole block list"
      />
      <li>Choose static ip address</li>
      <p>
        When your devices need to connect to your pi, we need to be able to keep
        the ip address of the pi the same. Hit yes to assign a static ip address
        to your pi.
      </p>
      <img
        class="pihole_image"
        src="../../assets/pihole/pihole_ip.webp"
        alt="PiHole static ip"
      />
      <p>
        The installer will then ask you if you want to enable the web admin
        interface, I would check 'On' and continue.
      </p>
      <img
        class="pihole_image"
        src="../../assets/pihole/pihole_ui.webp"
        alt="PiHole admin portal"
      />
      <li>Finally, select your privacy mode</li>
      <p>I would check 0 and continue.</p>
      <img
        class="pihole_image"
        src="../../assets/pihole/pihole_ftl.webp"
        alt="PiHole ftl"
      />
      <p>
        Your installation should be complete! This final page will give you your
        static IP, the link to your pihole admin webpage, and the login password
        for it.
      </p>

      <h2>Router Setup</h2>

      <br />
      <p>
        In order for your devices to connect to your pihole instance, you'll
        need to change the primary ip address DNS server your router uses to
        your raspberry pi ip address. Now, all requests that go through your
        router will use your pihole instance to filter ads.

      <h2>Verify Installation</h2>
      <h5>May 16, 2021</h5>
      <br />
      <p>
        To make sure that your pihole is fully set up, let's go to your pihole
        admin page. Get your raspberry pi's ip address, and put that into your
        browser. ex. 192.168.1.28 and log in. If you are unable to log in using
        the randomly generated password, run this command to set a new password:
      </p>
      <code>pihole -a -p</code>
      <br />
      <p>
        You should be able to get to this page and see some requests getting
        blocked.
      </p>

      <p>You should be all set from here!</p>
